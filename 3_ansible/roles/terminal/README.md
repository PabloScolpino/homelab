Role Name
=========

Setup remote terminal to my defaults

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - import_playbook: playbooks/ansible_dependencies_installed.yml
    - import_playbook: playbooks/user_in_sudoers.yml
    - hosts: all
      roles:
        - terminal
